    Context manager for safe file operations with automatic cleanup.

    Ensures file descriptors are always closed, even if an exception occurs.

    Args:
        path: File path (str or bytes)

    Yields:
        c_void_p: File pointer for use with libc functions

    Raises:
        OSError: If file cannot be opened

    Example:
        with open_file("key.pem", "wb") as fp:
            gmssl.sm2_private_key_info_encrypt_to_pem(key, passwd, fp)
